# Locality-Sensitive-Hashing_PySpark

This Code uses data from the Movie-lens dataset having 7 million+ movies. Option to choose a subset of the dataset (e.g. only 10K titles) also present.
In this code we implement localitiy sensitive hashing step-by-step and apply that on detecting almost duplicate names.
